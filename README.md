Binary Trees Are Graphs
You may use graphs to a lot of things, such as think
In computer science, a binary tree may have many ways
to be present in a computer.
Here we are implementing this trees in C
using pointers, stacks, and recursion, we give
phisical presence to a whole forest full of binary
trees, in the Random Access Memory. Where every node
of the tree will have it's own space and way to
communicate with it's two childs and it's only one
parent.
Only one root,only two childs to every node max.
It may look as an array, but it's a tree actually.

0 - root
1 - 0's left child
2 - 0's right child
3 - 1's left child
4 - 1's right child
5 - 2's left child
6 - 2's right child
7 - 3's left child
8 - 3's right child
9 - 4's left child
10 - 4's right child

For what?

Binary Search Tree:

to compute data inside nodes inside a huge database
to search data in huge databases, very fast
to file encription
in the creation of compilers
to add and delete nodes inside databases

Trees brothers are stacks and queues, for example.

the differences of trees are:

are a non-linear way to store data
Have less rules to access data
thank's to recursion, can be read from the bottom up
just a reference to the root is enough to start
leaping inside nodes, that's why it's easier to jump
to the childs "whitout" knowing the parents
that's why we can know what's the left, the right, the
levels up, the levels down, and so on.
